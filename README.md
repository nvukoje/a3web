We are a consultancy specializing in data analytics within GIS and have created a website for our company that showcases our skills.
Our skillset will include the skills we have learned during our schooling and training in technical abilities at Fleming College.

HTML/CSS/Javascript Work Distribution (For both home page and secondary pages following).

Kamryn - Navbar with links to both home page and services page. Doing responsive design to be enabled on mobile as well as general CSS Layout.

Nem - Image sourcing (compression for images, retaining size), Javascript/CSS interaction for images. Using images as links. CSS for tables.

Ewan - Setting classes, ID's for text and other content (focusing on specificity) to be referenced throughout all webpages. CSS formatting for box-models.

Louise - HTML elements (headers, div and paragraphs) to be uniform amongst all web pages for later CSS box-sizing.

HTML Content Distribution:

Louise: 

•	Geovisualization - Using Cartographic design, such as colour, symbology, and typography using industry standard, graphic design software, we can help you create a map for your needs.
1. We can produdce any type of map or visual display you would like, at any scale to effectively and professionally display what you would like to communicate.
2. Use our cartographic skills to support decision making processes in government, commercial, consulting, other organizations, or general public to help you share your message in a visually appealling and informative way.

•	Spatial Analysis - Allow us to help you with solving complex location-oriented problems.
1. We can explore and understand your data from a geographic perspective, determine relationships, detect and quantify patterns and assess trends
2. We then make predictions and decisions based on your needs.


Nem: Focus on companies GIS database principles and how data from remote sensing can be allocated into a dataset.

• GIS Database Principles - Our ability to work with and manage database design and processing within the GIS environment. Using SQL is our specialty in building databases and manipulating data for analysis and cartographic presentation.
1. We can efficiently organize and prepare data for GIS software interchangeably.
2. Our SQL queries can retrieve data in multiple tables.
3. Those same queries can perform calculations to manipulate stored data.
4. We can create custom forms, reports and interfaces for end users.
5. Capable of transferring data between databases and other applications.
6. We can design simple conceptual models for relational databases for any given problem.

• Remote Sensing and Image Analysis - The consultancy provides services of measuring physical, biological and cultural features from satellite and aerial imagery. We also use photogrammetry in scale determination and measurements. Through our knowledges of the electro magnetic spectrum, we work with raster data and provide both geometric and atmospheric corrections on our images.
1. We contrast electromagnetic regions for base and thematic mapping
2. Use industry standard remote sensing software to extract information
3. We extract information through interpretation of spectral target properties
4. Our workflows register satellite and airboprne imagery (photogrammetry) to earth coordinates
5. We implement image classification, image enhancement and image filtering strategies. We also describe colour theories and image fusion enhancement strategies.

Ewan: impact of earth dynamics on measuring and recoding physical data.

• Surveying and CADMapping - We acquire spatial and attribute data, in the field, and efficiently integrate new data back in the office. Leveraging the skill sets within the consultancy, associated with measuring for maps and land-type surveys, we place field data into existing maps and plans. These collected features are then placed in a GIS/Land Information System and appended to existing digital maps and plans.
1.	We apply field measurements for a given surveying project to map the dimensions of the land.
2.	We adjust survey data using the principles of elementary plane surveying so that the information can be used in a GIS.
3.	Using CAD know how, we produce maps with graphic attributes and organize elements using overlapping map layers to represent field work.
4.	Using COGO (coordinate geometry) expertise, we calculate, measure, and analyze existing and new field data and determine data quality of field work.
5.	We know how to handle surveying tools and equipment appropriately, in-compliance with industry safety and operating standards.

• Geodesy - we use the science related to the determination of the size and shape of the earth. Due to the curvature of the earth, geodetic principles are applied to small scale maps covering large areas. We posess an deep knowldge of this foundational science and the issues involved in measuring and mapping the earth, such as applying appropriate map projections and coordinate systems.
1.	We make accurate map scale and ground dimension measurements and calculations to provide superior map reading and application development services.
2.	We have deep knowledge of the nature of the earth's size, shape, and spherical coordinate systems.
3.	We explain the fundamental nature of the earth's measurements, the geoid, ellipsoids, techniques of geodetic surveying, and the creation of datums.
4.	We recognize the general ramifications of transforming the round earth to a flat plane and can establish the characteristics and appropriate uses of various common types of map projections.
5.	We leverage modern geodetic techniques for measuring the earth and recognize how modern technology enhances our understanding of earth processes.
