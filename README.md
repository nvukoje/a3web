Demonstrating skillset for the "consultancy services"

Louise: 

•	Geovisualization - Exploration of the cartographic communication process. Effective geographical display is dependent upon the decisions involved in its design, such as colour, symbology, and typography in map making. Students will also be introduced to concepts and processes that are central to cartography, build a cartographic foundation for subsequent studies. Industry standard, graphic design software will be used to create various paper products and screen images.
1.	Describe and apply fundamental techniques used to retain a high degree of positional and attribute accuracy while capturing, structuring and displaying geographic data.
2.	Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats, data compilation scales and coordinate systems, to create cartographic products that effectively communicate at a variety of scales.
3.	Create maps and visual displays based on recognized cartographic design principles that communicate geographic information effectively.
4.	Proficiently employ industry standard software packages used in organizations that rely on GIS and cartographic products.
5.	Produce an advanced cartographic product from planning to data acquisition to implementation using cartographic design principles and by integrating multiple software platforms to effectively communicate cartographic information to a wide audience.
6.	Describe how cartographic skills are being used to support decision making processes in government, commercial, consulting, and other organizations.

•	Spatial Analysis - Explore the principles and fundamental concepts and types of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and apply them in projects. Five main technical components of a GIS, namely, input, storage, pre-processing, analysis and output using both the raster and vector spatial data models. Hands-on experience, using current software applications is provided through a series of laboratory exercises.
1.	Compare and select the most appropriate data model and GIS analysis method for a given problem at an introductory level.
2.	Describe and perform basic GIS analysis with a variety of different data models using appropriate geoprocessing techniques.
3.	Develop work flows to accomplish specific objectives and tasks at an introductory level.
4.	Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats and coordinate systems, to solve spatial problems.
5.	Apply geoprocessing techniques using a model builder to solve spatial problems.
6.	Effectively perform and complete a Spatial Analysis real world project scenario from data acquisition to pre-processing to analysis using a variety of geoprocessing techniques to explore and analyze spatial problems; develop and automate workflow solutions; and validate and present results.
7.	Using professional and technical language of GIS describe how spatial analysis techniques can be used in industry with respect to their economic and social importance and their future potential.
