Demonstrating skillset for the "consultancy services"

Louise: 

•	Geovisualization - Exploration of the cartographic communication process. Effective geographical display is dependent upon the decisions involved in its design, such as colour, symbology, and typography in map making. Students will also be introduced to concepts and processes that are central to cartography, build a cartographic foundation for subsequent studies. Industry standard, graphic design software will be used to create various paper products and screen images.
1.	Describe and apply fundamental techniques used to retain a high degree of positional and attribute accuracy while capturing, structuring and displaying geographic data.
2.	Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats, data compilation scales and coordinate systems, to create cartographic products that effectively communicate at a variety of scales.
3.	Create maps and visual displays based on recognized cartographic design principles that communicate geographic information effectively.
4.	Proficiently employ industry standard software packages used in organizations that rely on GIS and cartographic products.
5.	Produce an advanced cartographic product from planning to data acquisition to implementation using cartographic design principles and by integrating multiple software platforms to effectively communicate cartographic information to a wide audience.
6.	Describe how cartographic skills are being used to support decision making processes in government, commercial, consulting, and other organizations.

•	Spatial Analysis - Explore the principles and fundamental concepts and types of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and apply them in projects. Five main technical components of a GIS, namely, input, storage, pre-processing, analysis and output using both the raster and vector spatial data models. Hands-on experience, using current software applications is provided through a series of laboratory exercises.
1.	Compare and select the most appropriate data model and GIS analysis method for a given problem at an introductory level.
2.	Describe and perform basic GIS analysis with a variety of different data models using appropriate geoprocessing techniques.
3.	Develop work flows to accomplish specific objectives and tasks at an introductory level.
4.	Procure, interpret, transform, and integrate data from various sources, in different formats and coordinate systems, to solve spatial problems.
5.	Apply geoprocessing techniques using a model builder to solve spatial problems.
6.	Effectively perform and complete a Spatial Analysis real world project scenario from data acquisition to pre-processing to analysis using a variety of geoprocessing techniques to explore and analyze spatial problems; develop and automate workflow solutions; and validate and present results.
7.	Using professional and technical language of GIS describe how spatial analysis techniques can be used in industry with respect to their economic and social importance and their future potential.

Nem:

• GIS Database Principles - Our ability to work with and manage database design and processing within the GIS environment. Using SQL is our specialty in building databases and manipulating data for analysis and cartographic presentation.
1. We can efficiently organize and prepare data for GIS software interchangeably.
2. Our SQL queries can retrieve data in multiple tables.
3. Those same queries can perform calculations to manipulate stored data.
4. We can create custom forms, reports and interfaces for end users.
5. Capable of transferring data between databases and other applications.
6. We can design simple conceptual models for relational databases for any given problem.

• Remote Sensing and Image Analysis - The consultancy provides services of measuring physical, biological and cultural features from satellite and aerial imagery. We also use photogrammetry in scale determination and measurements. Through our knowledges of the electro magnetic spectrum, we work with raster data and provide both geometric and atmospheric corrections on our images.
1. We contrast electromagnetic regions for base and thematic mapping
2. Use industry standard remote sensing software to extract information
3. We extract information through interpretation of spectral target properties
4. Our workflows register satellite and airboprne imagery (photogrammetry) to earth coordinates
5. We implement image classification, image enhancement and image filtering strategies. We also describe colour theories and image fusion enhancement strategies.
