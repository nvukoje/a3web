            <p>The workday can be strenuous, fast paced and demanding, making keeping up and managing deadlines a constant battle.
               Every minute counts, even if its just a few. Todays programming capabilities in GIS software allow users to process data for analysis
               and automate redundant repetitive tasks that are time consuming that are taking you away from what you do best. That is where we come in,
               providing back end development solutions to help you automate your workflow and complete tasks that wouldn not be feasible otherwise.
               Our back-end solutions can become the fundamental separator between efficiency and problem solving capabilities, effectively improving the
               experience of the product or service you provide to your clientele, allowing you to do what you do best.</p>

                1. High level programming code, and algorithmic solution implementation (ex: python).
                2. Develop design techniques to solve simple programming, computational, and logic problems in a spatial context.
                3. Write documentation that explains program design and operation using a standard method allowing for easy future maintenance and
                   updates as needed.
                4. Create, design, and write modular automated and structured programs for structured selection and repetition tasks, and function
                   design requirements.
                5. Automate the data transfer process of writing and reading files between applications and reports.
                6. Develop model based object-oriented functionality specific to classes and domain structures for problems or applications.
                7. Management of error handling and testing to ensure the successful exaction of programs (syntax, runtime, and semantic).
                8. Create programs that automate spatial process that can be implemented across a team network and used collaboratively and equitably.
